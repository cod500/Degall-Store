## Reflection

- I wanted to create a project that was useful in the real world and solve problems dealing with an updating cart which I used session to solve.

- I went into the project with little knowledge of payment systems and was able to implement Stripe instead of Paypal which was an overkill for a mock project. I found Stripe was more developer friendly.  

- Creating iamges tied to each product and categories was a challenge. I found a StackOverflow solution where multer is used to upload the images and move-file is used to move the images to product folders.

- Although I used Bootstrap to make it mobile responsive, I designed the store from pure CSS which was difficut since designing is not my strength.

-Several technologies I learn and practiced with:
   - Node.js
   - REST APIs
   - Handlebars
   - Bootstrap
   - MongoDB
   - Passport
   - Stripe
